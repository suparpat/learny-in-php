Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-20">[20]</a>&nbsp;American psychologist&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zick_Rubin" title="Zick Rubin">Zick Rubin</a>&nbsp;sought to define&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics" title="Psychometrics">psychometrics</a>&nbsp;in the 1970s.

It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>&mdash;in particular,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer" title="Homer">Homer</a>&#39;s&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ancient Roman (Latin)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin language</a>&nbsp;has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot;&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amo#Latin" title="wikt:amo">am?</a></em>&nbsp;is the basic verb meaning&nbsp;<em>I love</em>, with the infinitive&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amare#Italian" title="wikt:amare">amare</a></em>&nbsp;(&ldquo;to love&rdquo;) as it still is in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian</a>&nbsp;today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come&nbsp;<em>amans</em>&mdash;a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery&mdash;and&nbsp;<em>amica</em>, &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is&nbsp;<em>amor</em>&nbsp;(the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>&mdash;in Latin:&nbsp;<em>Roma</em>&mdash;can be viewed as an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>amor</em>, which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-30">[30]</a>&nbsp;which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces&nbsp;<em>amicus</em>&mdash;&quot;friend&quot;&mdash;and&nbsp;<em>amicitia</em>, &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called&nbsp;<em>On Friendship</em>&nbsp;(<em>de Amicitia</em>), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Amatoria" title="Ars Amatoria">Ars Amatoria</a></em>&nbsp;(<em>The Art of Love</em>), which addresses, in depth, everything from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair" title="Affair">extramarital affairs</a>&nbsp;to overprotective parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latin sometimes uses&nbsp;<em>am?re</em>&nbsp;where English would simply say&nbsp;<em>to like</em>. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by&nbsp;<em>placere</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>delect?re</em>, which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus" title="Catullus">Catullus</a>.<em>Diligere</em>&nbsp;often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun&nbsp;<em>diligentia</em>, however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb.&nbsp;<em>Observare</em>&nbsp;is a synonym for&nbsp;<em>diligere</em>; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun,&nbsp;<em>observantia</em>, often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot;&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(virtue)" title="Charity (virtue)">Caritas</a></em>&nbsp;is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_literature" title="Latin literature">Roman literature</a>.

It can also be interpreted as a hand offering one&#39;s heart to another hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>&nbsp;which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohism" title="Mohism">Mohism</a>&nbsp;which championed a universal love. A core concept to Confucianism is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_(Confucianism)" title="Ren (Confucianism)">Ren</a></em>&nbsp;(&quot;benevolent love&quot;,&nbsp;?), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself. In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety" title="Filial piety">filial piety</a>&nbsp;from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of&nbsp;<em>Ai</em>&nbsp;(?) was developed by the Chinese philosopher&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi" title="Mozi">Mozi</a>&nbsp;in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism&#39;s benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (<em>ji?n&#39;&agrave;i</em>,&nbsp;??). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism" title="Chinese Buddhism">Chinese Buddhism</a>, the term&nbsp;<em>Ai</em>&nbsp;(?) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism,&nbsp;<em>Ai</em>&nbsp;was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary Chinese,&nbsp;<em>Ai</em>&nbsp;(?) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love.&nbsp;<em>Ai</em>&nbsp;is used as both a verb (e.g.&nbsp;<em>wo ai ni</em>&nbsp;???, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as&nbsp;<em>aiqing</em>&nbsp;??, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian&nbsp;<em>Ren</em>, the phrase &#39;Wo ai ni&#39; (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (<em>Wo xihuan ni</em>,&nbsp;????) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-31">[31]</a>&nbsp;This is also true in Japanese (<em>suki da</em>,&nbsp;???). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Persian</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi" title="Rumi">Rumi</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafiz_Shirazi" title="Hafiz Shirazi">Hafiz</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_(poet)" title="Saadi (poet)">Sa&#39;di</a>&nbsp;are icons of the passion and love that the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Iran" title="Culture of Iran">Persian culture</a>&nbsp;and language present.

Though modern usage of&nbsp;<em>koi</em>&nbsp;focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Many? used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Ryang2006-32">[32]</a>&nbsp;The third term,&nbsp;<em>ren&#39;ai</em>&nbsp;(??<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets" title="Help:Installing Japanese character sets">?</a>), is a more modern construction that combines the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" title="Kanji">kanji</a>&nbsp;characters for both&nbsp;<em>ai</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>koi</em>, though its usage more closely resembles that of&nbsp;<em>koi</em>&nbsp;in the form of romantic love.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Ryang2006-32">[32]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-About-33">[33]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Turkish (Shaman and Islamic)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>, the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;a?k.&quot;&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishq" title="Ishq">A?k</a></em>&nbsp;(a word of Arabic origin) is a feeling for&nbsp;<em>to love,</em>&nbsp;or being &quot;in love&quot; (A??k), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (A??k) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_language" title="Azerbaijani language">Azerbaijani</a>&nbsp;(e?q) and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language" title="Kazakh language">Kazakh</a>&nbsp;(?????).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Religious views</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Main article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_love" title="Religious views on love">Religious views on love</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Abrahamic religions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ahava.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Ahava.jpg/220px-Ahava.jpg" style="height:145px; width:220px" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Indiana" title="Robert Indiana">Robert Indiana</a>&#39;s 1977&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_(sculpture)" title="Love (sculpture)"><em>Love</em>sculpture</a>&nbsp;spelling&nbsp;<em>ahava</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Christianity</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian understanding is that love comes from God.

Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I was in love with love.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;According to Saint Augustine, to love God is&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;to attain the peace which is yours.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;(Saint Augustine&#39;s Confessions)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible.

Influential Christian theologian&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S._Lewis" title="C.S. Lewis">C.S.

He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape" title="Agape">agape</a>) and by receiving and experiencing God&#39;s love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa" title="Mother Teresa">Teresa of Calcutta</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary" title="Blessed Virgin Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>&nbsp;and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-vatican1-34">[34]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Thomas_Aquinas" title="St. Thomas Aquinas">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, who defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or to desire for another to succeed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-newadvent.org-10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies. As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo; But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;- Matthew 5: 43-48</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.

Amongst the 99 names of God (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah" title="Allah">Allah</a>), there is the name&nbsp;<em>Al-Wadud</em>, or &quot;the Loving One,&quot; which is found in Surah&nbsp;[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/011-qmt.php#011.090" rel="nofollow">11:90</a>]&nbsp;as well as Surah[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/085-qmt.php#085.014" rel="nofollow">85:14</a>]. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur&#39;an as&nbsp;<em>Ar-Rahman</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ar-Rahim</em>, or the &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur&#39;an refers to God as being &quot;full of loving kindness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qur&#39;an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with&nbsp;<em>birr</em>&nbsp;or &quot;deep kindness&quot; as stated in Surah&nbsp;[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/006-qmt.php#006.8-9" rel="nofollow">6:8-9</a>].&nbsp;<em>Birr</em>&nbsp;is also used by the Qur&#39;an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishq" title="Ishq">Ishq</a></em>, or divine love, is the emphasis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism" title="Sufism">Sufism</a>&nbsp;in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God &quot;looks&quot; at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being &quot;drunk&quot; due to their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_of_God" title="Love of God">love of God</a>; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Talks" title="Paris Talks">Paris Talks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1" title="`Abdu''l-Bahá">`Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute;</a>&nbsp;described four types of love:<a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-59.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The love that flows from God to human beings</li>\r\n	<li>The love that flows from human beings to God</li>\r\n	<li>the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God</li>\r\n	<li>the love of human beings for human beings</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Eastern religions</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Buddhism</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81ma" title="K?ma">K?ma</a></em>&nbsp;is sensuous, sexual love.

This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others&#39; welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>&nbsp;ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world.

Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti" title="Bhakti">bhakti</a></em>, which can be found in the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana" title="Bhagavata Purana">Bhagavata Purana</a></em>&nbsp;and works by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsidas" title="Tulsidas">Tulsidas</a>. The philosophical work&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narada_Bhakti_Sutra" title="Narada Bhakti Sutra">Narada Bhakti Sutras</a></em>, written by an unknown author (presumed to be&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narada" title="Narada">Narada</a>), distinguishes eleven forms of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unadulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)&mdash;two opposites .<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Krishna_Prema-37">[37]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one&#39;s material desires. They consider that K???a-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything&mdash;one&#39;s pride, religious rules, and one&#39;s shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gita_Govinda" title="Gita Govinda">Gita Govinda</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God&nbsp;<em>(taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya)</em>, and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination&nbsp;<em>(krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya)</em>. Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Perfect_Love-38">[38]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Political views</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Free love</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Main article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_love" title="Free love">Free love</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term&nbsp;<strong>free love</strong>&nbsp;has been used<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-39">[39]</a>&nbsp;to describe a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement" title="Social movement">social movement</a>&nbsp;that rejects&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, which is seen as a form of social bondage.

This mentality created a vision of strongly defined gender roles, which provoked the advancement of the free love movement as a contrast.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Spurlock.2C_John_C_1988-41">[41]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &quot;<strong>sex radical</strong>&quot; is also used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;, and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of &quot;free love&quot;.[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-Passet.2C_Joanne_E_2003-42">[42]</a>&nbsp;These are also beliefs of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" title="Feminism">Feminism</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Philosophical views</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Main article:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_love" title="Philosophy of love">Philosophy of love</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Where_is_the_love.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Where_is_the_love.jpg/220px-Where_is_the_love.jpg" style="height:165px; width:220px" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" title="East Timor">East Timor</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The philosophy of love is a field of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_philosophy" title="Social philosophy">social philosophy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a>&nbsp;that attempts to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation" title="Explanation">explain</a>&nbsp;the nature of love.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#cite_note-43">[43]</a>&nbsp;The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love, asking if and how love is or can be justified, asking what the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)" title="Value (ethics)">value</a>&nbsp;of love is, and what impact love has on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a>&nbsp;of both the lover and the beloved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many different theories attempt to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation" title="Explanation">explain</a>&nbsp;the nature and function of love. Explaining love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved would be very difficult because to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior.

Aggregately, dating resources indicate a nascent line of variables effectively synchronising couples in naturally determined yearning.</p>\r\n', 'fact', 1, '2016-05-22 16:53:25', '2016-05-22 16:53:25');
