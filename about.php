			<h4>Learny is place to share knowledge, stories, thoughts, ideas, et ceteraâ€”</h4>

			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
				Learny has a clutter-free design, allowing its users to focus on the actual contents. The design is actually based on <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>'s design combined with those of other places.
